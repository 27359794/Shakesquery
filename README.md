Shakesquery
==========

A search engine modelled on boolean retrieval methods. It's general purpose over text documents, but for demo purposes it searches over the complete works of Shakespeare.

This project was implemented for fun as a revision tool for UNSW's *COMP6714* course in Information Retrieval.
