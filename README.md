Shakesquery
===========

A simple search engine implementing the boolean retrieval model. It indexes general-purpose text documents, but for demo purposes it searches over the complete works of Shakespeare.

This project was implemented for fun as part of UNSW's *COMP6714* course in Information Retrieval.
